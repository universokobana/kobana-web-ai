Your operation needs to work in an automated way. Kobana solves this problem with automation, visibility and security, freeing up time for what's most important.

### Volume Management
Dealing with transaction volume is complex and expensive. You need a solution that simplifies and makes money flow absolutely securely and robustly. No transaction can be lost. Kobana manages to simplify processes, automate flow and handle exception cases that end up taking a lot of time from the operation.

# Webhooks Documentation

## Overview
Webhooks allow external systems to receive notifications of all events that occur in the system.

When an event happens, the system sends an HTTP POST request to the URL configured in the webhook with information related to the event.

Webhooks are also called Callbacks or Reverse API.

## How It Works
When an event is triggered within Kobana, notifications are generated for each webhook that is configured to receive that event.

These notifications automatically generate a request that is made to the URL configured in the webhook. Kobana keeps a record of all generated requests, as well as the request information (Request) and the response from the external server (Response).

## Request Headers
In addition to the normal headers of an HTTP POST request, the following headers are sent:

| Header | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| X-Kobana-Delivery-Id | Unique UUID for each delivery attempt |
| X-Kobana-Signature | Security signature to verify authenticity |
| X-Kobana-Event | Event code that generated the notification |
| X-Kobana-Environment | Environment (production or sandbox) |

## Available Events
- `charge.created` - When a new charge is created
- `charge.paid` - When a charge is paid
- `charge.canceled` - When a charge is canceled
- `charge.overdue` - When a charge becomes overdue
- `payment.created` - When a payment is created
- `payment.confirmed` - When a payment is confirmed
- `payment.failed` - When a payment fails
- `customer.created` - When a customer is created
- `customer.updated` - When customer data is updated

## Best Practices
### DO NOT process the payload immediately
- **DO NOT process the payload** sent at the time of receiving the Webhook
- Reception should always be responded to immediately with status code 200
- Save the sent payload in a Database, Redis, Kafka, RabbitMQ or any other service
- Respond with 200 immediately afterwards (process should take milliseconds)
- Process the payload only after the affirmative response

### Response Requirements
- **200 OK**: Correct and immediate response
- **498 Token Invalid**: For webhooks with invalid security signature
- **204 No Content**: For unknown/unexpected events
- **Do not use other codes** (422, 404, etc.) - indicates processing before response

### Failure Handling
- **Timeout**: 5 seconds maximum for response
- **Retries**: up to 7 times with increasing interval
- **Total Time**: Approximately 9 hours to complete all attempts
- **Retry Triggers**: Retries only for: 500, Timeouts, SSL/TLS Errors

### Security Considerations
- Use SSL/TLS on configured URLs
- Server must respond with full certificate chain
- Do not return confidential information in responses
- Verify security signature to ensure authenticity

## Webhook Payload Example
```json
{
  "event": "charge.paid",
  "data": {
    "id": "chr_1234567890",
    "amount": 10000,
    "paid_at": "2025-01-01T10:00:00Z",
    "customer": {
      "id": "cus_0987654321",
      "name": "João Silva",
      "email": "joao@example.com"
    }
  },
  "created_at": "2025-01-01T10:00:01Z"
}
```
